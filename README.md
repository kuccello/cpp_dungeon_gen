# Basic dungeon generator (C++)

This is a simple 2d dungeon generator I wrote in C++ in an effort to refresh my skills in C++. I have not written any code with C++ in quite some time (15 years in fact). I decided to start with something that was interesting enough to keep my attention without being too large to complete in a weekend.

It started when I did a search for how to procedurally generate a 2d dungeon and I settled on following the tutorial found here: http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-bsp-trees-to-generate-game-maps--gamedev-12268

I did an on the fly conversion to C++ of the algorithm presented in the tutorial and the code in this project is the result. I may tinker with this code a bit more but I consider it mostly done. Feel free to do with it as you please. Comments, code pull requests etc. welcome

Kind regards and happy dungeon crawling.
